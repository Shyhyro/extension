# Realmerge CWS

Mini version of Realmerge for Chromium-based browsers (Chrome Web Store).

# Links

* [Chrome Web Store page](https://realmerge.shay.cat/chrome)
* [Full Realmerge](https://realmerge.shay.cat)
* [Full Realmerge's repo](https://github.com/shayypy/realmerge)

# Releases

Chromium-compatible extensions can be loaded with just a folder containing the extension's contents, so I don't attach a `.crx` file (or whatever) to releases. Just download the source `.zip` and unzip it.

# Demonstration

A demonstration on Firefox 91, but it looks about the same on Chromium-based browsers :)
